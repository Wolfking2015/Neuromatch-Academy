## Welcome to OREL's Neuromatch Academy Study Group Materials & Epistemological Directories!
Neuromatch Academy (NMA), July 13-31 (2020)  

*Join our [discussion group](https://representational-brains-phenotypes.weebly.com/neuromatch-academy.html)! We will also be collaborating in groups using this repository, [OREL Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T48BNG3A5/C015B5V5TEH), and [OREL Keybase](https://keybase.io/team/orthogonal_lab).*

This GitHub Repo is a place to explore topics and ideas surrounding the NMA course prep and content. 
- In [Epistemological Directories (ED)](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Neuromatch-Academy/tree/master/Epistemological%20Directory), you will find a series of topical stubs, which you can contribute to with infographics, reference lists, notes and points to revisit, or even slideshows! 
- In [Student Folders](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Neuromatch-Academy/tree/master/Students), feel free to include an intro and any personal work associated with your NMA prep or ideas that may not fit into the shared Epistemic Directories section. 


Contributions can be made via [issues](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Neuromatch-Academy/issues), pull requests, or submitted via [e-mail](mailto:Orthogonal-Lab@outlook.com). 

- Have a question or idea? [Make an issue](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Neuromatch-Academy/issues), either in general, or related to an epistemic directory. 
- Contribute to [Epistemic Directories](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Neuromatch-Academy/tree/master/Epistemological%20Directory) by adding resources and your own understanding to the community's shared and collaboratively generated education materials.
- Check the [Project Board](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Neuromatch-Academy/projects/1) for requested topics, or add your own! 



You can also annotate this README using [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/start/) (using their Chrome plug-in or bookmarklet). 

For text-based pull requests, you should create .md files written in Markdown ([see tutorial here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zXlZ2tEndNPOO1vmL4_MoAt-Tqjd0dUU/view?usp=sharing) for a quick tutorial).

Don't forget to go through the preparatory materials! While the curriculum does not require a high degree of knowledge in Neuroscience or Computational thinking, you should brush up on the basics.
