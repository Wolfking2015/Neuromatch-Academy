# Causality in Neuroscience 

https://www.crowdcast.io/e/ohbm-causality

On July 2, 2020, there was a Crowdcast video chat session following up on a sidebar from [OHBM's conference](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageID=3989), wherein several associated with NMA spoke / engaged in a discussion about Causality in Neuroscience, and some of the obstacles and limits therein.
 
Symposium abstract:  Elucidating the Causality in “Causal Brain Circuits”: Theory, methods, and applications (Organizer: Manjari Narayan)

-  What Does it Mean for Brain Regions to Causally Influence one Another and Why Don't Functional/Effective Connectivity Count as Causal - Konrad Kording
-  Carving up Brain Functions from an Evolutionary Perspective   - Paul Cisek
-  What Kind of Kinds are Optimal for Causal Discovery in Clinical Neuroscience?  - Jacqueline Sullivan
-  When Do We Need Etiological Brain-circuit Biomarkers? - Manjari Narayan



## Resources & Chat Links
During the crowdcast, several papers were mentioned. Here is an a non-exhaustive list (feel free to add more)

Nature Neuroscience
Conservation of brain connectivity and wiring across the mammalian cla
Brain connectivity and normalized wiring costs are conserved across mammals independently of brain size according to a common principle: species with fewer interhemispheric connections exhibit better intrahemispheric connectivity.

- https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06374 What does it mean to understand a neural network?
We can define a neural network that can learn to recognize objects in less than 100 lines of code. However, after training, it is characterized by millions of weights that contain the knowledge...

- an addition to philosophical works on causality (and rather shorther): https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causal-models/

It is slightly outdated but it has a number of resources for causal inference. I strongly think people should read works beyond Pearl (edited)

  Folks are asking for resources for learning about causal inference.
  Here is a comprehensive reading list since no one address all issues —
  What is causality?
  When is a causal relationship is knowable?
