# How to use this Epistemic Directories
Welcome! Please free to update and build out Epistemlogical Directories as you see fit.

How to do that?
- Have a question or interest in a topic? [Make an issue](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Neuromatch-Academy/issues), either in general, or related to an epistemic directory. 
- Check the [NMA Project Board](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Neuromatch-Academy/projects/1) for requested topics, or add your own! 

More Ideas
- Edit the subfolder's ReadMe file to add relevant links
- Create a jupyter notebook / google collab walking throug an application
- Submit a coding example (or start your own [personal folder](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Neuromatch-Academy/tree/master/Students))
- Embed questions or comments in existing Directories or works - that others can answer!

Consider this repo someplace between a wiki, database, and general collection of resources. 

Good luck with prep & study for Neuromatch Academy!
