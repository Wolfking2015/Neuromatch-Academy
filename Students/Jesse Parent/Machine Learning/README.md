#### Excerpt from NMA Pre-Course - Programming section
Programming

This course will be run using Python. If you've never programmed in Python, now is a good time to start practicing! We expect students to be familiar with variables, lists, dicts, the numpy and scipy libraries as well as plotting in matplotlib. Practice a little bit every day and you'll be in great shape by the time the class starts. We recommend the [Software carpentry 1-day Python tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/). For a more in-depth intro, see the [scipy lecture notes](https://scipy-lectures.org/). Finally, you can follow the [Python data science handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/), which also has a print edition. 

If you're coming from a Matlab background, you can quickly get up to speed with [this cheatsheet](https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/). You may also enjoy [this paperback](https://www.worldcat.org/title/neural-data-science-a-primer-with-matlab-and-python/oclc/973932708) on Neural Data Science with both Matlab and Python versions.
