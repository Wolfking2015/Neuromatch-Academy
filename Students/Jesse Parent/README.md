## Intro 
www.neuromatch.io - I wanted to make a Repo to host all of my Neuromatch Academy work. I'm thankful our lab, OREL, is hosting a prep & study group such as this, and extremely appreciatiev of all the effort going into Neuromatch 1.0, 2.0, and Academy. 

### Bio 
Currently a researcher  at OREL in the Representational Brains & Phenotypes Group, now working on the meta-brains project and previously on the developmental Braitenberg Vehicles. I'm applying to graduate programs in computation and cognition, and looking for opportunities in industries or research labs to further my career.
