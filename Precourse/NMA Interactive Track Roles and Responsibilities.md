# Expectations 
### Dates and Time: (July 13-31, 7-9 hours per day, Monday-Friday)
As an interactive NMA student you will be expected to:
- Be present for every day of the Academy in your designated time slots (we will choose a
time slot for you based on your indicated availability in the Round 2 application). This
consists of two parts:
a. Attend the tutorial with your pod and TAs (approximately 5.5 hours with a 1 hour
break in the middle)
b. Attend the project time slot with members of the pod for 2-3 hours each day in
addition to the tutorial session.
If you need to take a day or two off to do something else please discuss it with your TAs.

- Review the 30 minute pre-recorded intro lecture prior to the start of each day’s tutorial
- Actively work with other students in small groups to discuss lecture materials and
tutorials.
- Let the TA know if you’re sick and need to miss classes
- Be respectful and understanding of cultural differences. Please review the code of
conduct.
- Depending on your experience with python some of you will be required to complete a
python primer prior to the start of the course.
- Ask your institution to pay an enrollment fee of at most 100 USD (adjusted for your local
cost of living) or submit a fee waiver request if this is impossible


We encourage participation in professional development sessions as a means to develop a
professional network in the discipline. These will occur as optional sessions on the weekends
during the academy. More details about this will be given subsequently.
You will also be offered the opportunity to participate in mentoring sessions with leaders in
computational neuroscience from around the world. We encourage you to make the best out of
those unique opportunities!
Remember most importantly that this academy is what you make it. Our curriculum is designed
to work best for active learning, so you should ask questions of the TA, challenge the speakers
at Q&A sessions, be an active participant in your group. You’ll also be able to build your
network of contacts, with your TA, other students, and the faculty. Create opportunities to
engage, learn and build connections.

# Qualifications
- Minimum experience with python, including relevant python libraries (numpy, scipy and
sklearn). We will reach out to some of you about python resources
- If you are new to neuroscience, we highly recommend watching videos 1.1-1.6 and
2.1-2.4 from this coursera course. Here is also a short read on neuroscience.

# Evaluations:
There will be a survey that we would like you to complete before and after the course is
over to gauge learning outcomes. This is not a form of grading, or a test. We’d just like to know
how much you have learned in the course.
